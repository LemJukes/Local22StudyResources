# Local22StudyResources
A repository of study guide resources for the various referral list tests.

Bookmark List Instructions:
Download the html file to your system and then open it with a web browser. Its not organized at all yet but theoretically everything mentioned in the study guide has coresponding referrence information in those links. There are included library and purchase links to several books mentioned that contain a good deal of information. I tried to find info for everything outside of those texts, but there are somethings that are just not printed anywhere else.
